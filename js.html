        </li>
        <li id="sync">
          Synchronous JavaScript: As the name suggests synchronous means to be
          in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by
          one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement
          to get executed.
        </li>
        <li id="async">
          Asynchronous JavaScript: Asynchronous code allows the program to be
          executed immediately where the synchronous code will block further
          execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one.
        </li>
        <li id="async/await">
          Async/await makes your code look synchronous, and in a way it makes it
          behave more synchronously. The await keyword blocks execution of all
          the code that follows it until the promise fulfills, exactly as it
          would with a synchronous operation. It does allow other tasks to
          continue to run in the meantime, but the awaited code is blocked.
        </li>
        <li id="high-order">
          Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as
          arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
          Higher order functions are a result of functions being first-class
          citizens in javascript.
        </li>
        <li id="this">
          The “this” keyword refers to the object that the function is a
          property of. The value of “this” keyword will always depend on the
          object that is invoking the function.
        </li>
        <li id="call">
          call()-It’s a predefined method in javascript. This method invokes a
          method (function) by specifying the owner object. call() method allows
          an object to use the method (function) of another object. <br />
          apply()-The apply method is similar to the call() method. The only
          difference is that, call() method takes arguments separately whereas,
          apply() method takes arguments as an array. <br />
          bind()-This method returns a new function, where the value of “this”
          skeyword will be bound to the owner object, which is provided as a
          parameter.
        </li>
        <li id="closure">
          Closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner
          function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is
          created, at function creation time.
        </li>
        <li id="object">
          All javascript objects inherit properties from a prototype.On top of
          the chain is Object.prototype. Every prototype inherits properties and
          methods from the Object.prototype. A prototype is a blueprint of an
          object. Prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object
          even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object.
        </li>
        <li id="callback">
          A callback is a function that will be executed after another function
          gets executed. In javascript, functions are treated as first-class
          citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be
          returned by another function and can be used as a property of an
          object. <br />
          Functions that are used as an argument to another function are called
          callback functions.
        </li>
        <li id="memory">
          Memoization is a form of caching where the return value of a function
          is cached based on its parameters. If the parameter of that function
          is not changed, the cached version of the function is returned.
        </li>
        <li id="const">
          Constructor functions are used to create objects in javascript. f we
          want to create multiple objects having similar properties and methods,
          constructor functions are used.
        </li>
        <li id="dom">
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a programming interface
          for HTML and XML documents. When the browser tries to render a HTML
          document, it creates an object based on the HTML document called DOM.
          Using this DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements inside
          the HTML document.
        </li>
        <li id="arrow">
          Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They
          provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions.
          Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.
        </li>
        <li id="rest">
          Rest parameter ( … )-It provides an improved way of handling
          parameters of a function. Using the rest parameter syntax, we can
          create functions that can take a variable number of arguments. Any
          number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest
          parameter. It also helps in extracting all or some parts of the
          arguments. Rest parameter can be used by applying three dots (...)
          before the parameters. <br />
          Spread operator (…)-Although the syntax of spread operator is exactly
          the same as the rest parameter, spread operator is used to spread an
          array, and object literals. We also use spread operators where one or
          more arguments are expected in a function call.
        </li>
        <li id="promise">
          Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.
          Promise object has four states - <br />
          Pending - Initial state of promise. This state represents that the
          promise has neither been fulfilled nor been rejected, it is in the
          pending state. <br />
          Fulfilled - This state represents that the promise has been fulfilled,
          meaning the async operation is completed. <br />
          Rejected - This state represents that the promise has been rejected
          for some reason, meaning the async operation has failed. <br />
          Settled - This state represents that the promise has been either
          rejected or fulfilled.
        </li>
        <li id="classes">
          Introduced in the ES6 version, classes are nothing but syntactic
          sugars for constructor functions. They provide a new way of declaring
          constructor functions in javascript.
        </li>
        <li id="generator">
          Introduced in ES6 version, generator functions are a special class of
          functions. They can be stopped midway and then continue from where it
          had stopped. Generator functions are declared with the function*
          keyword instead of the normal function keyword:
        </li>
        <li id="weak">
          In javascript, Set is a collection of unique and ordered elements.
          Just like Set, WeakSet is also a collection of unique and ordered
          elements with some key differences: <br />
          Weakset contains only objects and no other type. An object inside the
          weakset is referenced weakly. This means, if the object inside the
          weakset does not have a reference, it will be garbage collected.
          <br />
          Unlike Set, WeakSet only has three methods, add() , delete() and has()
          .
        </li>
        <li id="map">
          In javascript, Map is used to store key-value pairs. The key-value
          pairs can be of both primitive and non-primitive types. WeakMap is
          similar to Map with key differences: The keys and values in weakmap
          should always be an object. If there are no references to the object,
          the object will be garbage collected
        </li>
        <li id="des">
          Object destructuring is a new way to extract elements from an object
          or an array
        </li>
        <li id="temp">
          Temporal Dead Zone is a behaviour that occurs with variables declared
          using let and const keywords. It is a behaviour where we try to access
          a variable before it is initialized.
        </li>
        <li id="obj">
          Object.create()-The Object.create() method creates a new object, using
          an existing object as the prototype of the newly created object.
          <br />
          Object.entries()-This is a simple function which converts JS objects
          to an array of arrays. With inner array is pair of key and value of
          the object. <br />Object.keys()-This function picks only keys (or
          property labels) of objects and returns an array.<br />Object.values()-This
          function picks only values of objects and returns an array. <br />
          Object.freeze()-This function freezes the object for any further
          changes (key or values). It may not throw any error (unless you are in
          strict mode) but there will be no effect of value change on your
          object. <br />
