          JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is
          lightweight and most commonly used as a part of web pages, whose
          implementations allow client-side script to interact with the user and
          make dynamic pages. It is an interpreted programming language with
          object-oriented capabilities.

          JavaScript was developed by Brendan Eich, who was a Netscape
          programmer. Brendan Eich developed this new scripting language in just
          ten days in the year September 1995. At the time of its launch,
          JavaScript was initially called Mocha. After that, it was called Live
          Script and later known as JavaScript.

        </li>
        <li id="sync">
          Synchronous JavaScript: As the name suggests synchronous means to be
          in a sequence, i.e. every statement of the code gets executed one by
          one. So, basically a statement has to wait for the earlier statement
          to get executed.
        </li>
        <li id="async">
          Asynchronous JavaScript: Asynchronous code allows the program to be
          executed immediately where the synchronous code will block further
          execution of the remaining code until it finishes the current one.
        </li>
        <li id="async/await">
          Async/await makes your code look synchronous, and in a way it makes it
          behave more synchronously. The await keyword blocks execution of all
          the code that follows it until the promise fulfills, exactly as it
          would with a synchronous operation. It does allow other tasks to
          continue to run in the meantime, but the awaited code is blocked.
        </li>
        <li id="high-order">
          Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as
          arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.
          Higher order functions are a result of functions being first-class
          citizens in javascript.
        </li>
        <li id="this">
          The “this” keyword refers to the object that the function is a
          property of. The value of “this” keyword will always depend on the
          object that is invoking the function.
        </li>
        <li id="call">
          call()-It’s a predefined method in javascript. This method invokes a
          method (function) by specifying the owner object. call() method allows
          an object to use the method (function) of another object. <br />
          apply()-The apply method is similar to the call() method. The only
          difference is that, call() method takes arguments separately whereas,
          apply() method takes arguments as an array. <br />
          bind()-This method returns a new function, where the value of “this”
          skeyword will be bound to the owner object, which is provided as a
          parameter.
        </li>
        <li id="closure">
          Closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner
          function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is
          created, at function creation time.
        </li>
        <li id="object">
          All javascript objects inherit properties from a prototype.On top of
          the chain is Object.prototype. Every prototype inherits properties and
          methods from the Object.prototype. A prototype is a blueprint of an
          object. Prototype allows us to use properties and methods on an object
          even if the properties and methods do not exist on the current object.
        </li>
        <li id="callback">
          A callback is a function that will be executed after another function
          gets executed. In javascript, functions are treated as first-class
          citizens, they can be used as an argument of another function, can be
          returned by another function and can be used as a property of an
          object. <br />
          Functions that are used as an argument to another function are called
          callback functions.
        </li>
        <li id="memory">
          Memoization is a form of caching where the return value of a function
          is cached based on its parameters. If the parameter of that function
          is not changed, the cached version of the function is returned.
        </li>
        <li id="const">
          Constructor functions are used to create objects in javascript. f we
          want to create multiple objects having similar properties and methods,
          constructor functions are used.
        </li>
        <li id="dom">
          DOM stands for Document Object Model. DOM is a programming interface
          for HTML and XML documents. When the browser tries to render a HTML
          document, it creates an object based on the HTML document called DOM.
          Using this DOM, we can manipulate or change various elements inside
          the HTML document.
        </li>
        <li id="bom">
          BOM stands for Browser Object Model. It provides interaction with the
          browser. The default object of a browser is a window. So, you can call
          all the functions of the window by specifying the window or directly.
          The window object provides various properties like document, history,
          screen, navigator, location, innerHeight, innerWidth.
        </li>

        <li id="use">
          The window object is created automatically by the browser that
          represents a window of a browser. It is not an object of JavaScript.
          It is a browser object. The window object is used to display the popup
          dialog box
        </li>
        <li id="his">
          The history object of a browser can be used to switch to history pages
          such as back and forward from the current page or another page. There
          are three methods of history object. <br />
          history.back() - It loads the previous page. <br />
          history.forward() - It loads the next page. <br />
          history.go(number) - The number may be positive for forward, negative
          for backward. It loads the given page number.
        </li>
        <li id="arrow">
          Arrow functions were introduced in the ES6 version of javascript. They
          provide us with a new and shorter syntax for declaring functions.
          Arrow functions can only be used as a function expression.
        </li>
        <li id="rest">
          Rest parameter ( … )-It provides an improved way of handling
          parameters of a function. Using the rest parameter syntax, we can
          create functions that can take a variable number of arguments. Any
          number of arguments will be converted into an array using the rest
          parameter. It also helps in extracting all or some parts of the
          arguments. Rest parameter can be used by applying three dots (...)
          before the parameters. <br />
          Spread operator (…)-Although the syntax of spread operator is exactly
          the same as the rest parameter, spread operator is used to spread an
          array, and object literals. We also use spread operators where one or
          more arguments are expected in a function call.
        </li>
        <li id="promise">
          Promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in javascript.
          Promise object has four states - <br />
          Pending - Initial state of promise. This state represents that the
          promise has neither been fulfilled nor been rejected, it is in the
          pending state. <br />
          Fulfilled - This state represents that the promise has been fulfilled,
          meaning the async operation is completed. <br />
          Rejected - This state represents that the promise has been rejected
          for some reason, meaning the async operation has failed. <br />

          Introduced in ES6 version, generator functions are a special class of

          had stopped. Generator functions are declared with the function*
          keyword instead of the normal function keyword:

        <li id="weak">
          In javascript, Set is a collection of unique and ordered elements.
          Just like Set, WeakSet is also a collection of unique and ordered
          elements with some key differences: <br />
          Weakset contains only objects and no other type. An object inside the
          weakset is referenced weakly. This means, if the object inside the
          weakset does not have a reference, it will be garbage collected.
          <br />
          Unlike Set, WeakSet only has three methods, add() , delete() and has()
          .

        <li id="map">
          In javascript, Map is used to store key-value pairs. The key-value
          pairs can be of both primitive and non-primitive types. WeakMap is
          similar to Map with key differences: The keys and values in weakmap
          should always be an object. If there are no references to the object,
          the object will be garbage collected

          Object.entries()-This is a simple function which converts JS objects
          to an array of arrays. With inner array is pair of key and value of
          the object. <br />Object.keys()-This function picks only keys (or
          property labels) of objects and returns an array.<br />Object.values()-This
          function picks only values of objects and returns an array. <br />
          Object.freeze()-This function freezes the object for any further
          changes (key or values). It may not throw any error (unless you are in
          strict mode) but there will be no effect of value change on your
          object. <br />
          The Object.getPrototypeOf()-method returns the prototype (i.e. the
          value of the internal [[Prototype]] property) of the specified object.

          On the other hand, the event.stopPropagation() method is used to stop
          the propagation of an event or stop the event from occurring in the

          JavaScript debugger keyword sets the breakpoint through the code

          position it is applied. Now, we can start the flow of execution
          manually. If an exception occurs, the execution will stop again on
          that particular line.

          Event Propagation mode determines in which order the elements receive
          the event. <br />
          Event Bubbling and Capturing are two ways of event propagation in the
          HTML DOM API, when an event occurs in an element inside another
          element, and both elements have registered a handle for that event.
          <br />
          The top-down process is called the capturing phase. In the capturing
          phase, events propagate from the Window down through the DOM tree to
          the target node. <br />
          The bottom-up process is called the bubblling phase. In the bubbling
          phase, the exact opposite occurs. In this phase event propagates or
          bubbles back up the DOM tree, from the target element up to the
          Window, visiting all of the ancestors of the target element one by
          one.

        <li id="scope">
          Scope Chain: It is the process in which, JavaScript engine searches
          for the value of the variables in the scope of the functions. However,
          the search is in a lexical manner. First of all the engine looks out
          in the current scope of the current function. If not found, it finds
          it in the parent funtion. <br />
          <br />
          Lexical Scoping: In a nested group of functions, accessing the
          variables which are declared outside the function call is lexical
          scoping also referred to as Static Scope. In simple words, JavaScript
          looks for variables in a way, If it can’t find a variable in its local
          Execution Context, it will look for it in its calling context. And if
          not found in its calling context. Repeatedly, until it is looking in
          the global execution context. And if it does not find then, it’s
          undefined.

        <li id="deleg">
          Event Delegation is basically a pattern to handle events efficiently.
          Instead of adding an event listener to each and every similar element,
          we can add an event listener to a parent element and call an event on
          a particular target using the .target property of the event object.
        </li>
        <li id="debounce">
          Debouncing in JavaScript is a practice used to improve browser
          performance. There might be some functionality in a web page which
          requires time-consuming computations. If such a method is invoked
          frequently, it might greatly affect the performance of the browser, as
          JavaScript is a single threaded language. Debouncing is a programming
          practice used to ensure that time-consuming tasks do not fire so
          often, that it stalls the performance of the web page. In other words,
          it limits the rate at which a function gets invoked.

        <li id="throt">
          Throttling or sometimes is also called throttle function is a practice

          A preflight request is a small request that is sent by the browser
          before the actual request. It contains information like which HTTP
          method is used, as well as if any custom HTTP headers are present. The
          preflight gives the server a chance to examine what the actual request
          will look like before it’s made. The server can then indicate whether
          the browser should send the actual request, or return an error to the
          client without sending the request.
