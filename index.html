        <li id="oops">
          Oops is a programming paradigm that relies on the concept of classes
          and objects. It is used to structure a software program into smiple
          reusable piece of code.
        </li>
        <li id="difference">
          Procedural Programming: Procedural Programming: is based on functions.
          1. It shows the data to the entire program. 2. It does not have scope
          for code reuse. 3. It follows a the concept of top-down programming.
          4. Nature of the language is complicated. 5. It is hard to modify,
          extend and maintain the code. Object-oriented programming: 1. It is
          based on real-world objects. 2. It encapsulates the data. 3. It
          provides more scope of code reuse. 3. It follows a bottom-up
          programming paradigm. 4. It is less complicated in nature, so it is
          easier to modify, extend and maintain.
        </li>
        <li id="use-oops">
          OOPs has clarity in programming. It has flexibility and simplicity in
          solving complex problems. Reuseage of code is easy as Inheritance
          concept helps to reduce redundancy of code.
        </li>
        <li id="basic-concepts">
          The basic concepts of OOPs are: Inheritance Encapsulation Polymorphism
          Abstraction
        </li>

        <li id="method-overloading">
          There is a concept where two or more methods can have the same name.
          But they should have different parameters, different numbers of
          parameters, different types of parameters, or both. These methods are
          known as overloaded methods and this feature is called method
          overloading.
        </li>
        <li id="method-overriding">
          Method overriding in OOP is a language that feature that allows a
          subclass or or child class to provide a specific impementation of a
          method that is already provided by one of it's superclasses or parent
          classes.
        </li>
        <li id="type-inheritence">
          1. Single Inheritance 2. Multiple Inheritance 3. Multi-level
          Inheritance 4. Hybrid Inheritance 5. Hierarchical Inheritance
        </li>
        <li id="object">
          Object: An object is an instance of a class and also It has its own
          identity and behaviour.
        </li>
        <li id="method">
          The method is a function that is associated with an object.
        </li>
        <li id="class">
          The class can be defined as a Collection of objects. It is a logical
          entity that has some specific attributes and methods.
        </li>
        <li id="constructors">
          The constructor has the same name as the class. A constructor is also
          a special kind of method. It is used to initialize objects of the
          class.
        </li>
        <li id="type-constructor">
          Private Constructor Default Constructor Copy Constructor Static
          Constructor Parameterized Constructor
        </li>
        <li id="class-structure">
          Class: Class is basically a User-defined blueprint from which objects
          are created. It consists of methods ( set of instructions) which are
          performed on the objects. Structure: A structure is also a
          user-defined collection of variables. Structures are also different
          data types.
        </li>
        <li id="access-modifier">
          Access modifiers or access specifiers are the keywords in
          object-oriented languages. It helps to set the accessibility of
          classes, methods, and other members.
        </li>
        <li id="inheritance">
          Inheritance is the most important aspect of OOP. It specifies that the
          child object acquires all the properties and behaviour of the parent
          object. It provides reusability of code.
        </li>
        <li id="hybrid-inheritance">
          Combination of multiple and multi-level inheritance is known as hybrid
          inheritance.
        </li>
        <li id="hierarchical-inheritance">
          Defining Hierarchical inheritance is basically when one base class has
          more than one subclasses. For example, the fruit class can have
          ‘apple’, ’mango’, ’banana’, ‘cherry’ etc. as its subclasses.
        </li>
        <li id="inheritance-limitation">
          It Increases the execution time and effort. It also requires jumping
          back and forth between different classes. The parent class and the
          child class is always tightly coupled.
        </li>
        <li id="superclass">
          A superclass or base class is also a class which works as a parent to
          some other class/ classes.
        </li>
        <li id="subclass">
          A subclass is a class that inherits from another class. For example,
          the class Bike is a subclass or a derived of Vehicle class.
        </li>
        <li id="polymorphism">
          Polymorphism defines the ability to take different forms. Polymorphism
          alllows uas to define methods in the child class with the same name as
          defined in their parent class.
        </li>
        <li id="static-polymorphism">
          Static polymorphism or static binding is a one kind of polymorphism
          which comes at compile time. example of compile-time polymorphism is:
          method overloading.
        </li>
        <li id="dynamic-polymorphism">
          Dynamic polymorphism, dynamic binding or Runtime polymorphism is also
          part of polymorphism which is basically solved during runtime. An
          example of runtime polymorphism: method overriding.
        </li>
        <li id="operator-overloading">
          Operator overloading is used to implement operators using user-defined
          types, based on the arguments passed along with it.
        </li>
        <li id="encapsulation">
          Encapsulation is used to restrict access to methods and variables. In
          encapsulates code and data are wrapped together within a single unit
          from being modified by accident.
        </li>
        <li id="data-abstraction">
          Abstraction is defined as a process of handling complexity by hiding
          unnecesssary information from the user it increases the efficiency of
          the program.
        </li>
        <li id="achieve-data">
          Data abstraction can be achieved using two ways: Abstract class
          Abstract method
        </li>
        <li id="abstract-class">
          An abstract class is also a class which is consists of abstract
          methods.
        </li>
        <li id="abstract-method">
          These methods are basically declared but not defined and If these
          methods need to be used later in some subclass that time those methods
          haveto be exclusively defined in the subclass.
        </li>
        <li id="virtual">
          Virtual functions are also part of the functions which are present in
          the parent class and they are overridden by the subclass. These
          functions help to achieve runtime polymorphism.
        </li>
        <li id="deconstructor">
          A destructor is a method which is called automatically when an object
          is destroyed. The destructor also recovers the heap space which was
          allocated to the destroyed object. It also start closing the files and
          database connections of the object, etc.
        </li>
        <li id="copy-constructor">
          A copy constructor basically creates objects by copying variables from
          another object from the same class. The main focus of a copy
          constructor is to make a new object from an existing
        </li>
        <li id="finalize">
          Finalize is used to free the unmanaged resources and also help to
          clean before Garbage Collection(GC). It performs memory management
          tasks.
        </li>
        <li id="gc">
          Garbage Collection is a part of automatic memory management. The
          Garbage collector helps to free the occupied spaces by objects. Those
          spaces are no longer in existence.
        </li>
        <li id="final-variable">
          The final variable does not change and It always refers to the same
          object by the property of non-transversity.
        </li>
        <li id="exception">
          An exception is a kind of message that interrupts and comes up when
          there is an issue with normal execution of a program. Exceptions
          provide a error and transfer that error to the exception handler to
          resolve it. The state of the program is saved as soon as an exception
          is raised.
        </li>
        <li id="ex-handling">
          Exception handling in Object-Oriented Programming is the most
          important concept. It is used to manage errors. An exception handler
          help to throw errors and then catch the error in order to solve them.
        </li>
        <li id="error-exception">
          Error basically refer the problems and those problems should not be
          encountered by applications. Exceptions are basically conditions that
          an application might try to catch.
        </li>
        <li id="try-catch">
          A try/ catch block helps to handle exceptions. The try block explains
          a set of statements that may have an error. The catch block basically
          catches the exception.
        </li>
        <li id="finally-block">
          A finally block executes when the try block exits and It also executes
          even in case some unexpected exception is encountered. Finally block
          normally consists of some important part of the program.
        </li>
        <li id="call">
          •Yes, you are allowed to call the base class without instantiating it
          but there are some conditions that are applicable: •If it is a static
          method •The base class is inherited by some other subclass
